# Changelog

All notable changes to the Cultivars MCP server. Format adapted from [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) — augmented with the metrics + reasoning Copyleft Cultivars work tends to surface.

The unreleased section reflects work on the `refactor/plant-genomics-cultivars` branch (this PR).

## [Unreleased] — Community Science Layer

Transforms cultivars-mcp from a read-only genomics query layer into a
participatory community-science instrument: a write path for grower
observations, cryptographic attribution, collective statistical-power
reasoning, and bridges to formal accession systems and the offline field tool.

### Tool count: 19 → **28** (+9)
### Atlas: 30 → **35 categories** (added 5 orphan-crop seed entries)
### Tests: 91 → **137** (+46 unit/schema/adversarial; still no live network in tests)

### Added — write path & participatory tools

- **`submit_phenotype_observation`** — the write layer. Validates against the
  atlas + species tables, assembles a schema-v1.0 observation, writes a YAML to
  a configurable `ledger_dir` (default `./phenotypes/`), and returns the
  canonical form to sign + PR instructions. No GitHub credentials needed at
  runtime. Path components are sanitized against traversal.
- **`query_community_phenotypes`** — aggregates ledger YAMLs (count,
  measurement distribution, distinct accessions, signed-observation count).
- **`verify_observation_integrity`** — verifies detached **Ed25519** signatures
  over the canonical (signature-stripped, sorted-key JSON) observation form,
  using the `cryptography` package. Pseudonymous scientific attribution, *not*
  a financial instrument.
- **`pin_observation_to_ipfs`** — content-addresses an observation (+ optional
  VCF) via the kubo HTTP API; writes the CID back into the YAML. Structured
  fallback with setup instructions when no IPFS node is reachable.
- **`estimate_gwas_power`** — Bonferroni-corrected additive common-variant power
  calculation (pure-Python probit via Acklam, no scipy). Pulls the current
  sample size live from the ledger; surfaces the formula, assumptions, and the
  "recruit N more" gap. Honest caveats about kinship/structure correction.
- **`resolve_accession`** — bridges folk seed names to USDA **GRIN-Global**
  accessions and maps the taxon back to an Ensembl species string. Defensive
  parsing of GRIN's variable JSON shape.
- **`query_organellar_variants`** — first-class **Mt/Pt** genome queries with a
  curated organellar mini-atlas (CMS, plastid herbicide resistance, plastid
  photosynthesis). Wraps `search_variants_in_region` on the organellar chromosome.
- **`export_offline_snapshot`** — packages a trait's atlas entry, species
  coverage, and optional orthologs into a portable JSON for TinyLLamaFarmer
  (online → offline handoff).
- **`list_orphan_crop_requests`** — surfaces the `WANTED_TRAITS.yaml` bounty list.

### Added — data & licensing

- **`DATA_LICENSE.md`** — adopts **ODbL-1.0** for ledger data (open-data
  copyleft), distinct from the Apache-2.0 code license, to prevent enclosure.
- **`WANTED_TRAITS.yaml`** — orphan-crop contribution bounty list (fonio,
  bambara groundnut, enset, grass pea, quinoa).
- **`phenotypes/README.md`** — ledger layout + schema-v1.0 reference.
- 5 orphan-crop trait categories added to `TRAIT_ATLAS`:
  `teff_drought_tolerance`, `cowpea_heat_tolerance`,
  `finger_millet_calcium_accumulation`, `pigeon_pea_salinity_tolerance`,
  `amaranth_c4_photosynthesis`.

### Changed

- **`get_variant`** and **`search_variants_in_region`** gain an optional
  `population_context` parameter — per-population allele frequencies and a
  coarse Indica/Japonica Wright's Fst for richly-covered species; structured
  "not available" notice otherwise. Existing signatures preserved (new param
  defaults to `False`).
- `find_trait_genes` loose-matching now prefers a prefix match on a tie, so
  `'drought'` still resolves to `drought_tolerance` after orphan-crop keys like
  `teff_drought_tolerance` were added.
- Dependencies: added `pyyaml>=6.0` and `cryptography>=42.0` (the latter for
  Ed25519). YAML import is guarded so genomics tools still work without it.

### Deliberately NOT built (per the upgrade brief)

- No utility token / cryptocurrency / on-chain storage. Attribution is Ed25519
  + ODbL, never a financial instrument.
- ZK location proofs and foundation-model variant prediction are left as future
  work (flagged optional / lower-priority in the brief).

### Added — Living-document databases round (commit `c1207fe`)

- **`lookup_uniprot_entry`** — direct UniProt REST query. Returns manually-curated function statement, catalytic activity + EC number, cofactors, GO terms with evidence codes (EXP / IDA / IPI / IMP / IGI vs IEA / ISS), PubMed citations. **Works for Cannabis genes** (THCAS Q8GTB6, CBDAS A6P6V9) which are not in Ensembl Plants. Live-verified: Q8GTB6 returns "Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase", EC 1.21.3.7, FAD cofactor, 7 PubMed citations.
- **`search_pubmed_for_gene`** — Europe PMC REST literature search. Returns title, authors, year, DOI, PMID, open-access flag, citation count. The "living document" — returned 2025 + 2026 papers in DREB1A test (newer than training data).
- **`get_string_interactions`** — STRING-db protein-protein interaction network. Per-channel evidence scores (textmining / experimental / database / coexpression / neighborhood / fusion / phylogenetic). **Covers Cannabis sativa** (taxon 3483). Live-verified: SOS1 returns CIPK24 (canonical SOS2 partner) at score 0.999.
- **`compare_cannabis_strains`** — composed tool batching 2–5 Kannapedia strain lookups concurrently. Returns chemotype distribution, rarity distribution, and "genes flagged on multiple strain pages" overlap analysis.
- New per-API client-factory helpers (`_uniprot_client`, `_europepmc_client`, `_string_client`) for test injection.

### Added — Cannabis/Hemp/Corn round (commit `69ff5eb`)

- **`lookup_kannapedia_strain`** — LIVE fetch from Medicinal Genomics Kannapedia by RSP ID. Parses strain name, chemotype (Plant Type I/II/III), plant sex, Y-ratio, heterozygosity, rarity, grower, 12+ cannabis genes flagged on the page, S3-hosted VCF/FASTQ/BAM URLs, and up to 20 phylogenetically-related strain IDs. Live-verified against rsp13536 (Type I) + rsp13534 (Type III hemp).
- **`cannabis_strain_search_urls`** — search-URL constructors for Kannapedia, Leafly, SeedFinder, NCBI Taxonomy, EuropePMC (no HTTP, pure construction).
- **`list_maize_nam_founders(subpopulation)`** — the 26-line maize NAM founder panel from McMullen 2009 (PMID 19661427) + Hufford 2021 (PMID 34353948). Stiff Stalk, Non-Stiff Stalk, Tropical/Subtropical (CIMMYT CML + Thai Ki + IITA Tzi), Popcorn, Sweet Corn.
- 9 new trait atlas categories: `cannabinoid_biosynthesis` (7-enzyme pathway), `cannabis_terpene_profile` (CsTPS family), `hemp_compliance` (BT/BD allele system), `cannabis_sex_and_photoperiod` (MADC2, CsAuto, CsELF3), `cannabis_disease_resistance` (PMR loci, MLO orthologs), `general_lepidopteran_pest_resistance`, `maize_quality_protein` (Opaque-2), `maize_disease_resistance` (Ht1, Htn1, Rcg1), `maize_pest_resistance` (Mir1-CP).
- Cannabis fallback (`COMMUNITY_RESOURCES['cannabis_sativa']`) enriched to point at the new tools.

### Added — Atlas veracity backbone (commit `b63cacc`)

- **`lookup_gene_evidence`** — pulls Ensembl `/xrefs/id?all_levels=1`. Groups cross-references by database: UniProt/SWISSPROT (gold-standard manual curation) vs SPTREMBL (auto-annotated), GO term count, Plant Reactome pathways, PDB structures, TAIR/RAP-DB/MaizeGDB authoritative refs, BioGRID/STRING. Computes evidence_tier: `high_curated` / `moderate_auto_annotated` / `low_some_annotation` / `minimal`.
- `atlas_evidence.json` — cached evidence audit results, committed to the repo. Populated by `evals/atlas_audit.py`. Loaded at module init; `find_trait_genes` enriches each gene with the cached tier.
- 10 canonical atlas entries gained `primary_ref` (PubMed-cited seminal characterization paper) + `evidence_level` (knockout_phenotype / transgenic_complementation / qtl_mapped) fields: DREB1A, SOS1/2/3, SUB1A, NRT1.1B, PSTOL1, SD1, TB1, ALMT1, SbMATE, BADH2.
- Symbol-resolved evidence fallback: even atlas genes without explicit `ensembl_id` (e.g. SOS1) get evidence enrichment via the symbol→ID secondary index.

### Veracity audit results (real measured numbers, 93 atlas genes)

- 73.1% UniProt/SWISSPROT manually curated
- 24.7% in Plant Reactome pathways
- 23.7% with PDB-solved 3D structures
- Mean 11.0 / median 8 GO terms per gene
- 10.8% unresolvable — all are pre-flagged literature handles with citations

### Added — Trait atlas fixes + composed tool + species quality (commit `75f4773`)

- **M1: Trait atlas discoverability** rose from 66.2% → 84.9% (+18.7 pp) after adding `ensembl_id` fields to 24 entries, switching rhizobial_nodulation genes from Lotus japonicus (not in Ensembl Plants) to Medicago truncatula (in Ensembl Plants), and fixing symbol-vs-display-name mismatches.
- **`translate_trait_to_species`** — composed tool with `ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=6)` concurrency. M2: workflow latency dropped 11.66s → 3.13s (3.7× speedup). M3: tool calls dropped 7 → 1.
- **`_SPECIES_QUALITY` table** — 4 tiers (`richly_covered` / `moderately_covered` / `gene_models_only` / `not_in_ensembl_plants`) surfaced inside response shapes for `search_variants_in_region`, `get_variant`, `find_trait_genes`, `translate_trait_to_species`.
- 3 new atlas categories: `cell_wall_biosynthesis`, `grain_quality` (Wx/Waxy, BADH2/fgr basmati fragrance), `photosynthesis_c4` (PEPC, NADP-ME, PPDK, RBCS1A).

### Added — Test infrastructure + retry helper + CI + FORK_NOTES (commit `3e0583f`)

- `tests/test_server.py` — pytest suite using `httpx.MockTransport` (no live network). 36 → expanded across rounds → 89 tests. Runs in ~1.2s.
- `_get_with_retry` helper — Retry-After-aware backoff on 429/503 status codes. Initially on Ensembl only; expanded to all 5 APIs in docs round.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — GitHub Actions matrix on Python 3.10 / 3.11 / 3.12.
- `_CLIENT_FACTORY` test seam in `server.py` enables `httpx.MockTransport` injection for unit tests.
- **`FORK_NOTES.md`** — memo to the upstream EVEE Claude Opus author documenting what carried over, what changed, live-API data points (PHYB → AT2G18790 → 88 GO terms → 4 PDB structures), the `/lookup/id` 400-vs-404 gotcha, hexaploid wheat homoeologs, `Mt`/`Pt` chromosomes, ortholog one2one vs many2many at deep taxonomy levels, Cannabis sativa data-gap rationale. 3 postscripts add improvement deltas, veracity audit, and integration testing.
- `pyproject.toml` — declared `[project.optional-dependencies] dev = ["pytest>=8.0"]`, `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` config.

### Refactor round (commit `0e74ece`) — initial fork rebuild

- MCP server name `evee` → `cultivars`
- Backend: Goodfire EVEE API (human ClinVar) → Ensembl Plants REST API (~80 plant species)
- Coordinate convention: 0-based half-open → 1-based fully-closed (matches VCF/GFF, what plant biologists actually use)
- 8 initial tools: `list_plant_species`, `lookup_gene`, `search_variants_in_region`, `get_variant`, `predict_variant_effect`, `compare_variants`, `get_orthologs`, `get_sequence`
- 18 initial trait atlas categories
- `COMMUNITY_RESOURCES` table for Cannabis (not in Ensembl Plants) with structured fallback pointing at NCBI CS10 + Cannabis Genome DB

### Removed (vs upstream EVEE)

- `wait_for_variant_analysis` — Ensembl REST is synchronous; no equivalent of EVEE's on-demand `/analysis` endpoint
- `get_variant_disruptions` — folded into `predict_variant_effect`
- `get_variant_annotations` — no annotation-probe array in Ensembl
- The `pathogenicity_score`, `interpretation`, `evee_url` fields — clinical-only concepts that don't transfer to plant genomics
